  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <div class="article-content">
    <h2>ApplePie Toolkit CSS</h2>
    <div class="mbl">
      <p>Simplest way to get started - straight CSS Toolkit version that includes everything you need to do rapid prototyping.
      It's a good choice if you need a simple tool for building web interface and you are ok with 'default UI'. Just grab a CSS file (applepie.css or applepie.min.css),
      include it to a web page and start doing markup without additional efforts on styling elements. </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/railsware/applepie/releases/download/v0.1.0/applepie-0.1.0.zip" class="button mrs">ApplePie Toolkit CSS</a> <span class="muted">v0.1.0</span>
    </div>
    <h2>Feel full power with SASS</h2>
    <div class="mbl">
      <p>If you are using SASS preprocessor you can feel all advantages of using it's amazing features like nested selectors, mixins, loops etc.
      ApplePie Toolkit is built using mixins as tiny fun—Åtions that generate CSS rules to create UI objects.
       If you choose to follow ApplePie naming convention, there is a <strong>manifest</strong> CSS file
       where all class names for objects are defined and corresponding mixins are allready in place.</p>
<!--       <p>This means that you can have a pool of as many different button mixins as you want (including written by yourself) and you
      can change buttons appearance just by calling different mixins inside <code>.button</code> class in manifest file.</p> -->
    </div>
    <h2>Installing with Bower</h2>
    <div class="mbl">
      <p>If you haven't installed <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a> previously:</p>
      <pre><code>
    npm install -g bower
      </code></pre>
      <p>Now you can add ApplePie Toolkit to a project by including it to <code>bower.json</code> file or just fetch it to your project
      folder: </p>
      <pre><code>
    cd MY_PROJECT
    bower install applepie
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <h2>Installing as a Ruby Gem</h2>
    <div class="mbl">
      <p>ApplePie toolkit is also available as ruby gem, for easy integration into a Ruby on Rails apps or any other ruby frameworks.
        Just add gem to a Gemfile:</p>
      <pre><code>
        gem 'applepie-rails'
      </code></pre>
      <p>And run bundler</p>
      <pre><code>
        bundle install
      </code></pre>
      <p>Alternatively you can install it system wide:</p>
      <pre><code>
        gem install applepie-rails
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="mbm">
      <h2>Custom build</h2>
      <p>You can also get latest version by checking applepie directly from github repo.</p>
      <pre><code>
    git clone git@github.com:railsware/applepie.git
    cd applepie
      </code></pre>
      <p>Now you can install (if you haven't done this yet) grunt and all needed nodejs modules and use built in grunt tasks to create build of applepie.</p>
      <pre><code>
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt build
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>This will build css and sass versions of ApplePie to <code>dist</code> directory. </p>
