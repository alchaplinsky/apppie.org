    <h3>What is ApplePie? Is it a framework?</h3>
    <p>Well basicaly it is a set of conventions on naming, CSS organization and code style that bring standards into frontend development. This conventions can be used by any developer or team of developers and it doesn't matter if they write custom code from scratch or use any of available CSS frameworks. However it comes with a conventions-based framework, that may be used by developers as any other CSS framework. But if want to stick to ApplePie's conventions and you want to take some framework to start with, we recommend you to get started wit ApplePie Toolkit, because it is based and build on this conventions and you can easily extend or modify it.</p>
    <h3>Can I use ApplePie Toolkit as a replacement of Bootstrap?</h3>
    <p>Right now Toolkit has only basic elements (like navigation, buttons, form fields, tables) for building interface, and you might miss some building blocks that you got used to in Bootstrap. But components can be easily added and toolkit is in active development, so we'll do our best to provide developers with all needed stuff. However Toolkit has it's own grid system, set of helpers and good enough set of components to give a solid foundation to build everything on top of it.</p>
    <h3>Do I need any pre-processor to use ApplePie Toolkit?</h3>
    <p>ApplePie Toolkit is built on SASS. </p>
    <h3>Well it sounds good.. But do you really think that ApplePie conventions will help in 100% cases?</h3>
    <p>Actually no. There will always be special cases, complex and interesitng tasks which developers definetly have to solve themselves. That's the initial idea - framework solves most of common every day tasks so that you focus on dealing with special cases. </p>
